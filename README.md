# number_squared_and_weight_processor

This Python project handles user input, processes numbers and weights, and performs various calculations such as squaring numbers, calculating the average and maximum of weights, and sorting the data.

## Features:

1. **Squaring Numbers:**
   - Prompts the user to enter a number of values.
   - Validates the user input to ensure they enter valid integers.
   - Squares the entered numbers and displays the result.

2. **Weight Management:**
   - Collects 4 weight values from the user.
   - Displays each weight with its index.
   - Calculates the average and maximum weight.
   - Allows the user to choose a weight based on its index.
   - Sorts and displays the weights in descending order.

## Usage:

1. **Squaring Numbers:**
   - The program first asks how many numbers you want to enter.
   - Then, for each number, it prompts you to input a value. If you enter an invalid input (non-numeric), it will prompt you again until a valid number is provided.
   - After all numbers are entered, the program will display both the entered numbers and their squared values.

2. **Weight Management:**
   - The program asks for 4 weight values.
   - After inputting the weights, it will display each weight and its position.
   - It then calculates and displays the average and maximum weight.
   - You will be prompted to choose a weight by its position (1 to 4).
   - Finally, it sorts the weights in descending order and displays them.
